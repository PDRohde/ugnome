# Use of correlated information in precision medicine

## Study overview

### Design details
We used a fully adjusted two stage procedure for adjusting and normalising the response variable (PMID: 30653739). In the first stage, the response variable (data field 137) was adjusted for sex, age, UK Biobank assessment centres and the first 10 principal components.

In the subsequent estimation of summary statistics the same set of covariates were included to further increase statistical power.
